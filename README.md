# Large Field Log Handler
=======================

## Introduction
------------

`large-field-log-handler` is a suite of programs designed to facilitate the scanning of logs for the LargeFieldAnalyzer. This project is built to operate independently and is decoupled from other modules of the LargeFieldAnalyzer, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.

Features
--------

*   **Independent Operation**: Works as a standalone component, separate from other modules of the LargeFieldAnalyzer.
*   **Log Scanning**: Efficiently scans and processes logs generated by the LargeFieldAnalyzer.
*   **Integration Ready**: Designed to seamlessly integrate after the startup of the Analyzer node.

Requirements
------------

*   The code is intended to run within the Analyzer node.
*   It should be operational post the completion of the startup process, with the Analyzer functioning nominally.

Setup and Installation
----------------------

Before proceeding with the setup, ensure that you have the necessary environment for running the code, particularly within the Analyzer node.

### Prerequisites

*   Python (Version x.x.x or later)
*   MongoDB (Version x.x.x or later)
*   Access to Cloudflare R2 storage (with necessary API credentials)
*   Node.js environment (only if you are integrating with JavaScript components)

### Environment Setup

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine or the Analyzer node:
    
    shCopy code
    
    `git clone [repository-url]`
    
2.  Navigate to the cloned directory:
    
    shCopy code
    
    `cd large-field-log-handler`
    
3.  Install the required Python dependencies:
    
    shCopy code
    
    `pip install pymongo requests`
    
    If integrating with JavaScript components:
    
    shCopy code
    
    `npm install`
    
4.  Set up the required environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and fill in the necessary details:
    
    makefileCopy code
    
    `MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri DB_NAME=your_db_name COLLECTION_NAME=your_collection_name R2_API_KEY=your_r2_api_key R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_r2_account_id`
    

### Running the Program

1.  To run the Python script:
    
    shCopy code
    
    `python path/to/script.py`
    
    Replace `path/to/script.py` with the actual path of the Python script you intend to run.
    
2.  For JavaScript integrations, execute the corresponding script:
    
    shCopy code
    
    `node path/to/script.js`
    
    Replace `path/to/script.js` with the actual path of the JavaScript file.
    

Usage

Describe the typical workflows and how to use the program. This might include:

*   How to initiate a log scan.
*   How to interpret the results/output of the program.
*   Configuration options (if any).
